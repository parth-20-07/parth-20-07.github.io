# Brief Introduction on Project

This is a comprehensive project focused on implementing basic sensor fusion techniques and attitude estimation algorithms. This project showcases the use of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data to accurately estimate 3D orientation and attitude. Key features of the repository include the implementation of algorithms for gyroscope and accelerometer data analysis, calibration techniques for sensor data alignment, and the integration of sensor fusion methods for enhanced accuracy.
