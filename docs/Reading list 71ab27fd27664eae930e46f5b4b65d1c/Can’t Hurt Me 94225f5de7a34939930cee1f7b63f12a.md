## Notes

- Challenge 1: Make a list of all bad hands you are dealt:
    - Mom had a high temper and short fuse. It made me a hot head and easy to get angry.
    - I have a high level of ego when someone jokes on me.
    - I am not fit. I get tired easy
    - I am still a lot lazy.
    - I am loosing hair.
    - My confidence is not good.
    - I get intimidated easily when someone raises their voice.
    - I don’t know how to talk to new people.
    - I overestimate what I know by doing things I have done a 1000 times.
    - I still don’t know a lot of essential concepts in robotics.
    - I cannot think anything authentic and can only do derivative work.
- Challenge 2: Create an Accountability Mirror
- Challenge 3: Step out of your comfort zone. List the things you are not comfortable with and do them:
    - Go for Ballroom Dancing
    - Ask your friends to take your photos
    - Learn to be more in front of camera
    - Join the Taekwondo Class
    - Make your bed

## Key takeaways

- Do not take the easy way out
- Everyone is dealt a bad hand. It just looks different. Rich are given too much to realize that they need to learn and Poor are given too little to be able to learn.
