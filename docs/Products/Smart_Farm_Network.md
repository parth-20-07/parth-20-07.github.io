> GitHub URL: [parth-20-07/Smart-Farm-Network](https://github.com/parth-20-07/Smart-Farm-Network)

## Brief Introduction on Project

The Smart Farm Network is an advanced agricultural monitoring system designed to deliver real-time environmental insights. This system, using a network of sensor nodes combined with a central server, provides comprehensive data analysis to enhance and optimize farming operations.

Equipped with sensors for:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Lux
- CO2

Each node collects environmental data at set intervals, with integrated RTC for accurate timestamping and BLE technology for server communication.

Server Functionality:

- Manages data from over 50 nodes
- performing data analysis and issuing alerts.

Key functions include:

- Data processing with cloud uploads
- HMI display control
- Configuration management
- OTA updates for firmware.

This project stands as a testament to innovative solutions in precision agriculture technology.
