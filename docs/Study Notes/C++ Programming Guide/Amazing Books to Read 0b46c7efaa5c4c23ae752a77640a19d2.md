**My Personal Thoughts:** Amazing book for someone who has prior knowledge in C++ and wants to fill out any spaces in their knowledge. Contains many things that you might have missed out or never understood. Book is to the point on the topic, no unwanted jargon, and has easy to understand write-up. This book can be a great starting point to learn about new topics that you might not know, and use google/other references to expand on the knowledge if required.

***Lot of my notes on C++ on this page has been picked up as starting point from this book.***
