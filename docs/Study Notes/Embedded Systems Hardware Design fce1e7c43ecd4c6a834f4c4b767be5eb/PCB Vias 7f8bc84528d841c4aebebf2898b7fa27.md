# Basics

<aside>
⏰ **Vias are Vertical connections in the third dimension(Z) of a PCB**

</aside>

- Used for connection between layers allowing traces to ‘jump’ between layers in PCB.
- Can be used to improve air circulation around PCB for better thermals.
- Can be used to reduce eddy-current in the circuit if it is an issue.
- Generally ‘tiny’ through holes.

## Parameters

- Minimum Drill Size and Annular Ring Size are provided by the manufacturer based on their machine specifications.

<aside>
⚠️ It is always suggested to set the PCB software minimum tolerances higher than manufacturer tolerances to avoid the risk of error in manufacturing.

## Current Handling

For a general rule of thumb:

1 X Via → 1.5 Amps (~regardless of size)

For higher currents, simply use multiple vias in parallel.

Use Saturn Toolkit to choose the right via for current handling.

## Terminologies

- Pad Size: Total Diameter of the Via
- Drill Size: Size of the hole via
- Annular Ring: The Metal Pad around the Via
- Tenting: Covering your ‘via' using a Solder Mask. Uncovered Via can be used as Test Points or Cooling. Cover Vias provide better temper protection and waterproofing.
- Filling:

# Placement

**TO-DO:**

- Keep adequate distance between vias and traces to avoid manufacturing failure. Minimum Distance is provided by the Manufacturer's Guideline for PCB.
- Keep Different signals vias as far as possible to avoid coupling issues between signals.

**Power/GND Vias**

- Keep as close to the IC Pad as Possible
- Keep the Width of Via the same as the trace width
- Keep Ground and Power Pad close to each other to reduce inductance.

**Differential Pair Vias**

- Keep them as close as possible keeping the manufacturing tolerance in mind.
- Keep in mind that close vias don’t cut the other layers into different groups.

## Voiding

- This is the issue caused because vias have an isolation ring around the annular ring to separate a layer from the via. This can result in the issue of cutting a plane into parts or causing small island formation if vias are kept too close to each other.
- Voiding can result in high-impedance routes and EMI introduction in high-frequency circuits.

# Transfer Vias

Transfer Vias are needed when we are using Vias for high-frequency signals ( >20 kHz ) which can result in the introduction of noise if not coupled well Ground Plane.

**TO-DO:**

- Place a Ground Via near a Signal Vias to provide better coupling.
- Multiple Transfer Vias can share a common ground ‘via’ if they are nearby.

# Stitching Vias

Vias are used to connect similar types of planes and create them as a single unit.

**Reasons:**

- Connecting multiple GND/PWR layers has the following benefits:
    - Reduces Inductances
    - Ensures Copper Islands don’t act as antennae, resonate, and radiate.
    - Reduces Eddy Current due to reduced surface area.
- **Shielding**: Stitching vias can be used for shielding to suppress the energy of electromagnetic waves up to a certain frequency from entering/leaving a section of the PCB. The stitching via distance can be calculated using:
    
    $$
    L = \frac{1}{20}*\frac{c}{\sqrt{\epsilon}f_{max}} 
    $$
    

**TO-DO:**

- Stich the Power Places at certain intervals.
- To reduce shielding, calculate minimum distance and place the vias around high frequency circuit areas.
