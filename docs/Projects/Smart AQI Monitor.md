## Brief Introduction on Project

![[sm-aqi-bg.png]]

The Smart AQI Monitor is a sophisticated wall-mounted device designed to measure various air quality parameters and send it to a centralized database for logging and online monitoring. This device is built for industrial applications and is equipped with EU accepted sensors, ensuring accurate and reliable measurements.

The device measures: 

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Carbon dioxide
- Carbon monoxide
- Dust particulate levels (PM AE 1.0, 2.5, 10.0)
- Light intensity
- Volatile organic components like ozone and methane.

Features:

- 6-hour battery backup
- Type C charging
- An interactive touch screen display
- Precise sensor
- AQI calculation
- Wi-Fi connectivity for data upload to AWS Database
- MicroSD card data backup.

Designed for industrial air quality monitoring, this project demonstrates advanced hardware integration and software development for environmental monitoring.
