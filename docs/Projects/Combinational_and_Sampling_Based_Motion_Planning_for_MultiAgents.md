## Brief Introduction on Project

The objective of this task is to showcase the use of combinatorial and sampling-based techniques for path planning. Our approach involves implementing A* planning in a continuous space while considering the kinematic limitations of a vehicle across state lattices. Additionally, we employ a probabilistic road map method to assist the aforementioned technique.
