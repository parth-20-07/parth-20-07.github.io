## Brief Introduction on Project

This project is focused on implementing and comparing three fundamental algorithms in graph theory and computer science: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm, using C++.

- DFS: This algorithm aims for the fastest path planning but does not guarantee the shortest path.
- BFS: Known for finding the shortest path by scanning the entire environment, BFS can be time and memory-intensive.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: While being a bit more time-consuming compared to BFS, it provides the shortest path possible. 

This repository seems to be a practical exploration of these algorithms, highlighting their distinct characteristics and applications in solving graph-related problems.
