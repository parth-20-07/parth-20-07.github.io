## Brief Introduction on Project

 This project is dedicated to designing a Robust Controller for a 2-DoF (Degrees of Freedom) Revolute Revolute Arm, focusing on precise trajectory tracking. The project utilizes the Equation of Motion derived for the identical RRBot to ensure accurate control and maneuverability.

A key aspect of the project is the simulation of the system using Gazebo, incorporating real-world physics to replicate the motion and control dynamics accurately. This approach provides a realistic representation of how the Robust Controller operates and manages the RRBot's movement.
