## Brief Introduction on Project

I worked on deriving the equation of motion by taking the derivatives of the Lagrangian Function. This method is called as Euler-Lagrange Method.

The Lagrange Equation uses the terms Kinetic and Potential Energy of the system. Where: $LE = KE - PE$

The Euler-Lagrangian Equations can be derived by taking a derivative of the Lagrangian Equations. Where,‚êç

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_{i}}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial{q_{i}}}= u_{i}
$$

This would result in an equation of form $a\ddot{q} + b\dot{q} + c{q} + d = 0$. We solve for $\ddot{q_{i}}$ which results in the equation of motion for the system. This system does not contain any form of input. Thus, $u_{i} = 0$ for all joints.
