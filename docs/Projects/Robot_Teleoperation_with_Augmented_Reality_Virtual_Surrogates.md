## Brief Introduction on Project

![[Unity Launch.png]]

This project focuses on designing a waypoint tracking system using Augmented Reality (AR) to simplify high-level tasks such as motion and path planning in drone operations. Inspired by a significant research paper, the project leverages the Unity Engine and is primarily built for Android devices, emphasizing intuitive AR interfaces for drone control.

Project Highlights:

- Waypoint tracking system enhanced with Augmented Reality.
- Facilitates high-level drone operation tasks.
- Built using Unity Engine, compatible with Android devices.
