## Brief Introduction on Project

In this project we have made this task autonomous, our multi-tiered drone network can perform these Search and Rescue (SAR) operations with higher accuracy keeping in mind the complexity of rescue sites and the time pressure. 

We aim to leverage the unique capabilities of our fleet of drones, including the Planner Drone, the Search Drone, and the Retrieval Drone, to perform effective search and rescue operations. By using the A* algorithm for motion planning, we can optimize the performance of our fleet of drones and improve the efficiency of search and rescue operations. 

Overall, the use of drones in search and rescue operations can save time, resources, and potentially, lives. This project aims to demonstrate the potential of drones in real-world applications and advance the field of search and rescue operations.
