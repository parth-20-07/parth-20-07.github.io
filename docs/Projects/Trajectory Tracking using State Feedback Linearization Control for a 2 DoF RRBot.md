## Brief Introduction on Project
 This project centers around designing a State Feedback Linearization Controller for a 2-DoF Revolute Revolute Arm, aimed at enhancing trajectory tracking capabilities. The primary focus is on developing an accurate control mechanism for efficient maneuverability and precision in trajectory tracking.

- Equation of Motion: The project starts by calculating the equation of motion for the system, laying the groundwork for controller design.
- Controller Design: The design of the controller involves creating a matrix-based feedback system that integrates with the dynamic equations of the robotic arm.
