## Brief Introduction on Project

This project is focused on the design of a State Feedback Controller for a two degrees of freedom (2-DoF) Revolute-Revolute (RR) arm, aimed at precise position control. It involves the use of advanced control systems techniques for robotic manipulators.

## Project Highlights

- Application of state feedback control for a 2-DoF RR robotic arm.
- Use of non-linear dynamics, with linearization for controller implementation.
- Identification of system's equilibrium points and linearization using these points.
- Stability and controllability checks using eigenvalues and controllability matrix.
- Controller design based on chosen complex poles and the calculated feedback matrix $K$.
