# Chapter 7

Mind is divided in 3 major sections:

  Mind --> CM[Conscious Mind: Aware when Awake]
  Mind --> NCM[Nonconscious Mind: Works 24/7]
  Mind --> SCMM[Subconscious Mind: Just Aware Level]
```

Mind management works in 2 methods:

```mermaid

  MM[Mind Management] --> Reactively
  MM[Mind Management] --> Proactively
```

- **Reactively**: Tends to be messy and you don’t actively control the response.
- **Proactively**: More Strategic and Preventative which needs active steps to clean our mind.

## Proactive Approach

- You need to actively work on bringing the memories from non-conscious mind to the conscious mind so you can actively modify it to get a new perspective on it.
- If the memories in conscious mind are toxic, you have the power to veto it.

# Chapter 8

- The neurocycle provides a way of accessing and directing the mind behind the mindset.
- Foundation principles of neuro cycle: *(in surgical terms)*
    1. Gather **(embrace)**: embracing the toxic thought, habit or trauma *(cutting open with the scalpel)*
    2. Reflect and Write **(processing)** are processing steps *(performing surgery)*
    3. Recheck and Active reach are **reconceptualizing** steps *(closing up and healing)*

---

**Embrace**: Embracing is accepting what has happened by understanding the signals your mind and body send you and not trying to suppress it actively. Here are a few tips to make it easier:

- Acknowledge the emotions and trauma.
- Accept that pain is inevitable and you should not be running/hiding/suppressing it.
- Know that you are not alone and can reach out to loved ones you can trust.
- Pain doesn't last forever and the sooner you learn to accept pain, the sooner can you work through it.
- When you embrace pain, your body will subconsciously start healing itself to overcome the pain.

---

**Processing**: The processing stage consists of deep reflection and writing consisting of asking the classic ‘W’ questions:

- who
- what
- when
- where
- why
- how
