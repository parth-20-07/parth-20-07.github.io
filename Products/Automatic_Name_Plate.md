# Automatic Name Plate

> GitHub URL: [parth-20-07/Automatic-Name-Plate](https://github.com/parth-20-07/Automatic-Name-Plate)

## Brief Introduction on Project

 I always wanted a glowing address plate for my house. Buy alas, I was born lazy !! I hate to turn ON and OFF the lights of my address plate for my house everyday. So, I have created an automatic address plate which turns the backlight ON/OFF on the programmed time. The base microcontroller used is ESP32 which connects to my home Wifi. After connecting to Wifi, it contacts the NTP server and updates it current time.

Features:

- Flexible On/Off Control. A single button press will initiate a WebServer which can be used to configure the SSID, Password, ON/OFF Time.
- AC Powered LED Control Board.
- Easy to use and configure.
